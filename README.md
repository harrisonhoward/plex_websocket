## Scope

This project is linked to the project [plex_discord_rpc](https://github.com/harrisonhoward/plex_discord_rpc). The purpose if this project is to allow a user to connect to an existing Plex Media Server via a WebSocket client. The expectation that when interfacing with this package you have the necessary configuration and authorization to access the server.

This was created to allow the `plex_discord_rpc` tool to connect to the user's chosen Plex Media Server so it can listen for new media to start playing.
